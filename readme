Created a simple API using typescript and express.

App structure is in products folder, same as DTO's.

To start project, u need clone it, then in terminal type 'npm i', then it should download all the packages i used.

After that, you can start the project in terminal with 'npm run dev'.

It will start the server listening 3000 port.

In this test task i used JSON-file as a database, just for example, but i could use postgresql or mongodb, but i
decided that this is not worth it.

So, here i leave an URL's to simplify your testing process.

1. Get all products localhost:3000/all-products, /GET

2. Get product by id localhost:3000/product?id=7e0d456d-41e1-4cb6-b0fe-4c387c1a91a8
   (this id is an example,id you can find in database file. Id passing in query string) /GET

3. Update product localhost:3000/product/update
   (you should pass current product id, name and price in request body) /PATCH

4. Create product localhost:3000/product/create
   (you should pass current product name and price in request body) /POST

5. Remove product localhost:3000/product/remove
   (you shoul pass current product id to remove it from database) /DELETE

PS. I could add a database connection but i decided, that main point is my possibility with working on
buisiness logic and understanding API concepts.Validation and DTO's are describing what we expecting to
recieve from FE, so u can look at it.

I hope that this solution fits your task.
